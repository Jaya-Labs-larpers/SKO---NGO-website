/**
 * Card grid layout that adapts to the number of items, and the image `sizes`
 * that match it.
 *
 * No card is squeezed below roughly 16rem: four cards only share a row from
 * xl, where each still gets ~265px, and below that they sit two by two rather
 * than three-and-an-orphan. Five fall to three-and-two rather than five
 * slivers.
 *
 * `sizes` has to describe the same layout or the browser fetches for the wrong
 * slot — the old blanket "33vw" pulled ~475px images into 265px cards on a
 * 1440px screen. The rem caps are the card width at the 75rem container.
 *
 * Tailwind only generates classes it can see literally, so every variant is
 * spelled out here rather than built with template strings.
