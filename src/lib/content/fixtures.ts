 * CONTENT STATUS
 * --------------
 * English copy comes from "SKO (Website) 14 August 2026 Last review by ED.docx" —
 * the content document signed off by SKO's Executive Director — as revised by
 * the September 2026 "website info" documents (cover, About, and one per
 * programme), which also supplied every photo in public/images. Programs are the
 * four funded projects the document describes: HALI, Children's Active
 * Citizenship (TFCF1), Promoting Children's Education and Health through FDP
 * (TFCF2), and Resilient City and Migration Dynamics (RCMD).
 *
 * Anything still bracketed as [NEEDS SKO] is a fact the document does not supply
 * and this file does not invent — see docs/FAQ-for-team.md for the full list
 * (donation bank/QR details and allocation %, volunteer roles, privacy retention line, first real news posts, and the actual report
 * PDFs).
 *
 * Khmer: titles, summaries, values, statistic labels and the FAQ answers are
 * translated and marked for review. Long-form body prose is English-only for
 * now and falls back with lang="en"; it needs a Khmer-speaking staff writer.

  'My name is Sok Vanny. I am a 57-year-old widow living in the Andoung 6 community, Sangkat Kouk Roka, Khan Prek Pnov. I am the primary caregiver for my two young grandchildren, who were left in my care after being abandoned by their parents.',
  'In the past, my family faced severe financial hardship and emotional distress. My only source of income came from harvesting wild vegetables and collecting snails to sell, earning barely 7,000 to 10,000 KHR per day. This was hardly enough to cover our basic daily meals, and on days I could not gather anything, we simply had no money for food.',
  'My life began to change for the better after receiving dedicated guidance, encouragement, and support from the Samatapheap Khnom Organization (SKO) team. They helped me understand the far-reaching impacts of living in hardship, particularly the risks of lacking proper legal documentation. SKO supported and facilitated the process of obtaining a Cambodian National ID Card for me and birth certificates for my grandchildren.',
  'These documents have been life-changing “Having birth certificates has made it significantly easier to access medical check-ups and healthcare for my grandchildren. They also allowed me to formally enroll them in school and secure vital nutrition assistance from the Voice Cambodia Organization. While having National ID Card, possessing official identification gives peace of mind, simplifies job applications, and allows to access legal micro-loans safely.',
  'This experience restored my strength and motivated me to keep moving forward. Inspired by this transformation, I now advocate within my village, helping my neighbors understand the importance of legal identity documents.',
  'Currently, I am gathering the necessary paperwork to apply for a Residence Book (Family Book), as the lack of this document still presents daily administrative challenges. Once my file is complete, I will seek further consultation and support from Mrs. Chhay Lim to complete the application process.',

A large majority of beneficiaries consider gender-based violence a serious issue. 89% of beneficiaries report more equitable decision-making within households, and 75% of female respondents report that they make decisions on financial matters in the household — see our [women's empowerment results](/impact/). 94% of beneficiaries surveyed know where to seek assistance if they or someone they know experiences gender-based violence.",

      'Under health, hygiene, and family well-being, the project improved access to basic healthcare for vulnerable families through 52 medical check-up sessions reaching 656 people within 2,624 indirect reaches, including children and elderly community members. Additional ear health services reached 159 people, particularly children, while health education promoted better sanitation, disease prevention, and awareness of available social protection and healthcare services. Environment Day activities engaged 289 direct reaches 1,156 indirect reaches and in practical hygiene and environmental actions, strengthening community responsibility for cleaner and healthier living environments.',

A total of 33,910 kg of rice was distributed to 313 families supporting 410 children, while an additional 1,900 kg of emergency rice supported 189 families. These interventions helped reduce immediate household financial pressure and food insecurity, allowing parents to better focus on supporting their children’s education and well-being. Community contributions in Sangkat Chbar Ampov further demonstrated local solidarity and strengthened community ownership.',
