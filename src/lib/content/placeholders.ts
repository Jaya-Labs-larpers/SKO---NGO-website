/**
 * The seam that keeps internal content markers off the public site.
 *
 * Unfinished copy is tracked in the source with bracketed markers —
 * `[NEEDS SKO]`, `[EXAMPLE]`, `[PLACEHOLDER …]` — so `scripts/content-review.mjs`
 * can list exactly what SKO still owes, and so nobody quietly invents a fact to
 * fill a gap (PRODUCT.md, principle 3). Those markers are a note to the team,
 * not copy: a visitor must never see one, and must never see the instruction
 * that follows it either ("Replace this with your own first post…").
 *
 * So the marker stays in the source and the value is dropped on the way out.
 * Every component already has an empty state — a section with nothing to say
 * hides itself rather than rendering scaffolding. The same pass runs over CMS
 * content, because a staff member drafting in Sanity can type a marker too.
 *
 * Enforced downstream by `contentFailures()` in scripts/readiness.mjs, which
 * fails the build if a marker still reaches the HTML.
