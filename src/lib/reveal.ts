/**
 * Content boxes (.reveal) rise into place from below as they come into view,
 * and again every time the visitor scrolls back down to them.
 *
 * Time-based rather than scroll-linked: a mouse wheel scrolls in steps, and an
 * animation tied to scroll position steps with it. A fixed-length transition
 * started on entry is smooth whatever the input.
 *
 * A box is only ever set aside while it is fully below the bottom edge of the
 * window, so the visitor never watches one disappear. Boxes already in view at
 * load are left alone until they have scrolled off the bottom once. Without
 * IntersectionObserver, or under reduced motion, nothing is touched at all.
