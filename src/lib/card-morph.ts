/**
 * Names the clicked card's image just before the page is swapped out, so the
 * cross-document view transition morphs it into the detail page's hero, which
 * carries the same name statically.
 *
 * Leaving a detail page drops that static name first: otherwise going from an
 * activity to its programme would morph one unrelated photo into another.
 *
 * Naming every card up front would lift each one out of the page-content
 * transition and snapshot images nobody clicked. Names are cleared first
 * because a page restored from the back/forward cache still carries the last
 * one, and two elements sharing a name cancel the whole transition.
