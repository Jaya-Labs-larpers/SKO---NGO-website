# Phase 1.3 — Component inventory & low-fi wireframe notes

## Component inventory

### Layout & chrome
| Component | Props / data | JS? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `BaseLayout` | `title`, `description`, `lang`, `ogImage`, `noindex` | — | `<html lang>`, meta, hreflang, JSON-LD slot |
| `Header` | `nav`, `lang`, `translationPath` | ~1 KB | Sticky, transparent-over-hero on home |
| `MobileNav` | same | included above | Full-screen panel, focus trap, `Esc` to close, `inert` on background |
| `LanguageToggle` | `currentPath`, `lang` | — | Two `<a>` tags, no JS. `hreflang` + `lang` attrs. Khmer label always in Khmer script |
| `Footer` | `siteSettings`, `nav` | — | 4-column → stacked |
| `SkipLink` | — | — | First focusable element |
| `Breadcrumbs` | `trail[]` | — | + `BreadcrumbList` JSON-LD |

### Content blocks
| Component | Notes |
|---|---|
| `Hero` | Variants: `home` (full-bleed image + overlay + dual CTA), `page` (compact, image optional) |
| `SectionHeading` | Eyebrow + h2 + optional intro. The rhythm device used everywhere |
| `ImpactStatStrip` | 3–4 `impactStat` cards. Numbers render as static text; **count-up animation only behind `prefers-reduced-motion`**, and honestly — recommend no animation. A number that animates reads as marketing; a number that just sits there reads as a fact |
| `ProgramCard` | Image, title, summary, arrow link. Whole card clickable via a stretched-link pattern (single `<a>`, no nested interactives) |
| `ActivityCard` | Cover, date (localized: `1 សីហា 2026` / `1 August 2026`), category chip, title, excerpt |
| `StoryQuote` | Pull-quote with attribution; silhouette fallback |
| `PartnerLogoWall` | Grayscale → color on hover; grouped by category; `<a>` wraps logo with accessible name = partner name |
| `ReportList` | Rows: title, year, type badge, language badge, file size, download icon. `<a download>` |
| `DirectorMessageCard` | **Special treatment — see below** |
| `OrgChartViewer` | **Special treatment — see below** |
| `RichText` | Portable Text renderer: headings, lists, links (external gets `rel="noopener noreferrer"` + icon), inline images, callouts, embedded quotes |
| `CtaBand` | Full-width teal band, headline + button. Donate / Partner |
| `JobCard` | Title, type, location, deadline (with "closes in N days") |
| `TeamGrid` | Photo, name, role. Groups: leadership / board / staff |
| `EmptyState` | "No open positions right now" — localized, never a blank page |

### Interactive
| Component | JS | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ContactForm` | ~4 KB + Turnstile | Variants: general / partner / volunteer. Honeypot, inline validation, aria-live status region |
| `Lightbox` | ~2 KB | Only used by `OrgChartViewer`. Native `<dialog>`, focus trap, `Esc`, pinch-zoom enabled |
| `Pagination` | — | Plain links, `rel="prev/next"` |
| `ResponsiveImage` | — | Sanity CDN srcset wrapper (see Tech Decisions) |

**Total client JS budget: under 15 KB gzipped, excluding the Turnstile widget** (which loads only on pages with a form). Everything else ships as HTML.

## The two special treatments

### Director's message
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ╱ 1px teal outline, 2px teal rule at top-left ╱ │
│                                                  │
│  ┌──────────┐   ❝  (decorative, teal, ~72px)     │
│  │          │                                    │
│  │ portrait │   Pull quote — display serif,      │
│  │  4:5     │   ~28px, generous leading          │
│  │          │                                    │
│  └──────────┘   Body message — sans, 17px        │
│                 [PLACEHOLDER 3–4 paragraphs]     │
│                                                  │
│                 ──────────── (signature rule)    │
│                 [PLACEHOLDER Name]               │
│                 Executive Director               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
- Desktop: portrait left (~38%), text right. Mobile: portrait on top, full width, capped at ~320px tall with `object-position: top`.
- Teal `#0F6E56` accent rule and quotation glyph. The `❝` is `aria-hidden`; the quote itself is a real `<blockquote>`.
- **Khmer note:** the editorial serif is Latin-only. In Khmer the pull quote falls back to the Khmer display weight (Kantumruy Pro SemiBold) at slightly larger size and 1.9 line-height — Khmer script has no serif tradition and faking one looks wrong. Documented in the design system.
- Everything (photo, name, title, message, pull quote) from `directorMessage`.

### Organizational structure
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [ org chart image, max-w-4xl ]      │  ← click / Enter to zoom
│  ⤢ hint icon, bottom-right           │
├──────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Caption: [PLACEHOLDER] …            │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```
- Container is a `<button>` wrapping a `<figure>` → opens a native `<dialog>` with the full-resolution image, pan/pinch-zoom on touch, `Esc`/close button, focus returned to the trigger.
- Required `alt` describing the reporting lines in words — an image of a chart is invisible to a screen reader otherwise. Field description in Sanity spells this out for staff.
- Below the image, an optional collapsible **text version** of the structure (a nested list) — this is the AA-safe route and it costs one CMS field. Recommend including it.
- Serves 2x on retina via Sanity CDN; the dialog loads the original.

## Responsive breakpoints
`sm 640 · md 768 · lg 1024 · xl 1280`. Content max-width `1200px`, prose max-width `68ch` Latin / `62ch` Khmer (Khmer glyphs are wider — the same ch count reads longer).

Mobile-first: every layout is designed at 360px first. Tap targets ≥ 44px. No horizontal scroll anywhere except the bank-details table, which scrolls inside its own container.
