# Phase 2 — Design system

**Visual deliverable:** open [design-preview.html](design-preview.html) in a browser. It carries the palette,
type specimens in both scripts, the full component kit, six desktop layouts and three mobile frames.
**Token source of truth:** [design-tokens/theme.css](design-tokens/theme.css) — moves to `src/styles/theme.css` in Phase 3.

---

## 1. Direction

**White is the material, not the background.** You asked for white; the whole system is built on that
rather than around it.

- **Structure comes from hairlines, not fills.** Every surface is `#FFFFFF` bounded by a 1px `#E1E8E5`
  border. Section banding uses `#F4F8F6` — a tint so slight it reads as a change in air pressure rather
  than a grey box.
- **The brand blue is rationed.** `#475D8C` appears as: primary buttons, a 44×3px accent rule above
  section headings, the impact numerals, link underlines, and two large filled areas per page maximum
  (one CTA band, the footer). Nothing else gets to use it.
- **The two light blues do the softening.** `#C3E9E8` and `#9BE1FF` carry chips, the decorative quotation
  mark, the page-hero wash, the donation-allocation bars, the registration badge and the input focus glow.
  They are surfaces, never text.
- **Shadows are the hover state, not the resting state.** On a white page a shadow reads as haze. Cards
  ship flat with a border; elevation appears on interaction. Shadow colour is `#111A2B` at low alpha, not
  black — neutral-black shadows look dirty against a cool white.
- **The numbers carry the trust.** Impact figures are set at 46px in teal, the largest type on the page
  after the H1, and every one carries a context line. "1,240 families" is marketing; "1,240 families since
  2007" is evidence. That distinction is the entire job of this site.

Result: institutional rather than campaign-y, which is what a grant officer needs to see in three seconds.

## 2. Colour

Full ramp with measured contrast in `theme.css`. Ratios are WCAG 2.1 relative-luminance calculations
against `#FFFFFF`, not estimates.

| Role | Token | Hex | Contrast | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Headings | `ink-900` | `#111A2B` | 17.4:1 | |
| Body | `ink-600` | `#414D63` | 8.5:1 | |
| Meta / captions | `ink-400` | `#5F6B82` | 5.4:1 | AA floor for small text |
| Dividers, disabled | `ink-300` | `#929BAD` | 2.8:1 | **Never text** |
| **Brand** | `blue-700` | **`#475D8C`** | 6.2:1 | Buttons, rules, numerals |
| Links, hover | `blue-800` | `#384A70` | 8.8:1 | |
| Secondary, icons | `blue-600` | `#5C74A6` | 4.6:1 | |
| Borders, underlines | `blue-200` | `#B9C6DE` | — | |
| Hover fills | `blue-50` | `#EFF3FA` | — | |
| Dark surface | `blue-900` | `#26314F` | 12.8:1 | Footer + one CTA band |
| **Support** | `aqua-200` | **`#C3E9E8`** | — | Chips, quote mark, notice wells |
| **Support** | `sky-200` | **`#9BE1FF`** | — | Accent bars, hero wash, focus glow |
| Error | `danger-700` | `#B42318` | 6.6:1 | Form errors, "closes in N days" |
| Success | `success-700` | `#067647` | 5.7:1 | Sent-form confirmation only |

Ink is blue-black rather than neutral grey, so text sits in the same family as the brand. `#475D8C`
lands at 6.2:1 — near-identical to the previous brand colour, so it passes AA for normal text and for
white-on-blue buttons without any compensating adjustment.

**The two supporting tints carry surfaces, never text.** Everything set on them uses `ink-900` or
`blue-800`, and all four combinations were measured: ink-900 on aqua 13.4:1, blue-800 on aqua 6.8:1,
ink-900 on sky 12.1:1, blue-800 on sky 6.1:1 — all AA.

`ink-300` is fenced off from text in the token file's own comments, so the constraint travels with the
code rather than living in a doc nobody reopens. No colour is ever the sole carrier of meaning — every
chip pairs colour with a word, every form error pairs colour with an icon and a sentence.

**Amber is gone.** The supporting tints now cover the allocation bars, and "closes in N days" uses the
error red — semantically right, and it adds no new hue. The only non-blue colours left are the two
semantics, and each exists purely to mean something.

## 3. Typography

| Role | Family | Loaded |
|---|---|---|
| Latin UI + body | Inter | 400/600/700, Latin subset |
| Khmer everything | **Kantumruy Pro** (fallback Noto Sans Khmer) | 400/600/700, `U+1780–17FF` subset |
| Display serif | Source Serif 4 | 600, Latin only — used for exactly one thing |

Self-hosted WOFF2, no third-party font request (ADR-006). Scale is fluid `clamp()`; body is **17px**, not
16 — most readers are on a phone, in daylight, on mobile data.

### Khmer rules, enforced in the base layer

These live in `@layer base` under `:lang(km)`, so they follow the language wherever it appears — including
a Khmer name inside an English sentence — instead of depending on a developer remembering per component.

| Rule | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `line-height` | 1.9 body / 1.5 headings | Subscript consonants (ជើង) and above-baseline vowel signs collide at Latin leading |
| `font-size` | +6.25% on `p, li, dd, figcaption` (em-scoped, never compounds) | Khmer reads smaller at the same nominal size |
| `letter-spacing` | `normal`, always | Tracking separates a cluster from its base consonant |
| `text-transform` | never — eyebrows drop uppercase in km | Khmer has no case |
| `hyphens` / `word-break` | `none` / `normal` | No inter-word spaces; forced breaks split clusters |
| Measure | 44rem Latin / 40rem Khmer | Same reading length, wider glyphs |

The preview shows the wrong-vs-right leading comparison side by side — it's the clearest argument for why
this is a system rule and not a stylistic preference.

**One deliberate exception:** the Director's pull quote is Source Serif in English and **Kantumruy SemiBold
at 24px/1.75 in Khmer**. Khmer has no serif tradition; faking one looks wrong.

## 4. Space, radius, elevation, motion

- Section rhythm `clamp(3.5rem, 2rem + 6vw, 7rem)`; gutter `clamp(1.25rem, .75rem + 2vw, 2.5rem)`;
  container 1200px.
- Radius: 8px buttons/inputs, 12px cards, 16px panels. No pills except the language toggle and pagination —
  fully rounded reads consumer-app, and this site needs to read institutional.
- Motion: 140ms hover, 220ms panels, one easing curve. **No scroll reveals, no parallax, and no count-up
  on the impact numbers** — a figure that animates on scroll reads as marketing. Everything collapses under
  `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## 5. The two agreed special treatments

**Director's message** — outlined card, 4px blue rule at top-left, decorative `"` in `aqua-200` and
`aria-hidden` (the quote itself is a real `<blockquote>`), Source Serif pull quote, signature rule with name
and title. Portrait 4:5 at ~300px on desktop, stacked and capped at 320px tall on mobile with
`object-position: top`. Photo, name, title, pull quote and body all CMS fields.

**Organizational structure** — image-first as agreed: a `<button>`-wrapped `<figure>` opening a native
`<dialog>` at full resolution, pinch-zoom on touch, `Esc` to close, focus returned to the trigger. Beneath
it, a collapsible **text version** of the reporting lines. I added that rather than substituting it — an
image of a chart is invisible to a screen reader and unreadable at 360px however good the zoom is, and it
costs one CMS field. The Sanity `alt` field's help text tells staff to describe the reporting lines in words.

## 6. Responsive behaviour

| Breakpoint | What changes |
|---|---|
| < 640 | 1-col cards · stats stack · nav → full-screen panel · buttons full-width · bank table → definition list · **hero photo moves above the white card** |
| 640–1023 | 2-col cards · stats 2×2 · director card still stacked |
| ≥ 1024 | 3-col cards · stats 4-up · director card side-by-side · horizontal nav |
| ≥ 1280 | Container caps at 1200px, gutters grow |

On mobile the hero photo sits *above* the white card rather than behind it. Text over a CMS-uploaded photo
at 375px is a contrast gamble no image can be trusted to win, and the site's AA commitment can't depend on
which photo a staff member picks next year.

## 7. Accessibility — what AA commits us to

Built in: measured contrast on every token · 3px `:focus-visible` blue ring, inverted to white on dark surfaces ·
skip link first in tab order · semantic landmarks, one `h1`, no skipped heading levels · focus trap and
restore on the mobile nav and lightbox · `lang` per locale and on inline foreign passages · per-field form
errors via `aria-describedby` with icon *and* text · `aria-live="polite"` status region · required alt on
every Sanity image field · 44px minimum tap targets · no horizontal scroll at 320px · layouts hold at 200%
zoom.

Verified in Phase 4, not assumed: axe-core clean on every route in both locales · full keyboard pass ·
Lighthouse ≥ 90 ×4 on the mobile profile in CI · a `document.fonts.check()` sweep confirming no Khmer glyph
falls back to a system font · 320px and 200%-zoom screenshots per page.

## 8. Notes on the placeholders

Everything in the preview is marked `[PLACEHOLDER]`. **No SKO facts, statistics, staff names, or a
director's name have been invented** — the numbers shown (1,240 / 3,800 / 18 / 96%) are visibly bracketed
placeholders demonstrating the component, not claims.

Khmer strings are structurally correct and idiomatic enough to demonstrate typography, but they are
placeholders. They must be written or reviewed by an SKO staff member before launch. Machine-translating a
child-protection NGO's mission and shipping it is not something I'll do.

## 9. Content control — what staff edit

Section 09 of the preview shows the Sanity editor as staff will see it.

**Every number is a field.** `impactStat` documents carry `value`, `displayValue`, `label` (en/km),
`context` (en/km) and `order`. `displayValue` is what lets staff type `10,000+`, `96%` or Khmer numerals
`៩៥%` instead of being stuck with a raw integer. Nothing on the site is hardcoded — program stats, report
years, job deadlines, QR images, bank details, the Director's photo and message, the org-chart image and
caption all live in the CMS. The only things that don't are the layout and these design tokens.

**Activity posts carry both languages in one document.** `Title (English)` / `Title (ខ្មែរ)`,
`Body (English)` / `Body (ខ្មែរ)`, side by side, one Publish button. Staff write both — as you confirmed.

**The language toggle does not translate.** It loads the same page from the Khmer field a staff member
typed. There is no machine translation in this build. If a Khmer field is left empty, that block falls
back to the English text with `lang="en"` on it, so the page still works and a screen reader still switches
voice correctly; the Studio shows a save-time warning but never blocks publishing. A "draft the Khmer for
me" button in the Studio is buildable as a Phase 4 add-on — it needs an API key and, for a child-protection
NGO, a human sign-off step. Out of scope unless you ask for it.

## 10. Open for your call

1. **Hero treatment.** Full-bleed photo with an overlapping white card (shown), versus a fully white hero
   with the photo beside the text. The card version survives a bad photo better, which matters when the
   image comes from a CMS.
2. **Impact numerals in `blue-700` vs `ink-900`.** Blue shown. Ink is more austere and arguably more
   auditorial.
3. **Success green.** The one remaining green is the sent-form confirmation. Standard signal, but if you
   want zero green anywhere, it becomes `blue-700` with a tick — say so and I'll switch it.
4. **Logo.** The preview uses a placeholder `SKO` monogram tile. If SKO has a real logo, send the file —
   it may shift the header proportions and, if the logo carries its own colour, the blue ramp.
